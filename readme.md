# Miguel Canedo - Personal Portfolio Website (Enhanced with CSS Techniques)

This project is a single-page personal portfolio website, initially built with HTML and internal CSS, and subsequently enhanced by refactoring CSS into an external stylesheet and applying advanced CSS techniques. It showcases my profile, skills, and projects with a focus on clean design, semantic structure, and engaging visual effects.

## Description

This portfolio provides an overview of Miguel Canedo, featuring:
*   A **full viewport hero header** with a prominent title and navigation.
*   An "About Me" section with a personal introduction.
*   A "Projects" section detailing three key projects.
*   A "Contact" form for visitors to get in touch.
*   A footer with copyright information and social media links.
*   **Smooth scrolling** for navigation links.
*   **Interactive hover effects** on navigation items and skill tags.
*   **Decorative elements** using CSS pseudo-elements.
*   **Subtle animations** on section load for a more dynamic experience.

## Features Implemented

*   **Semantic HTML5 Structure:** Utilizes modern HTML5 tags for a well-organized document.
*   **External CSS Styling:** All visual styling is handled by an external `styles.css` file located in `assets/css/`.
*   **Hero Header:** The initial view presents a full-screen header.
*   **Flexbox for Layout:** Used for centering content within the hero header.
*   **Smooth Scrolling:** Implemented via `scroll-behavior: smooth;`.
*   **Google Fonts Integration:** Uses the 'Roboto' font for a modern look.
*   **Image Integration:** Profile picture and project image.
*   **Project Showcase Table:** Displays project information clearly.
*   **Contact Form:** Standard HTML form structure.
