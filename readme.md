# Miguel Canedo - Personal Portfolio Website v3.0

This project is a fully responsive, multi-page personal portfolio website built from the ground up to showcase my skills as a web developer. It features a modern, clean design and is optimized for a seamless user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Description

This portfolio provides a comprehensive overview of my profile, projects, and contact information, structured across three distinct pages:

* **Homepage (index.html):** A welcoming "About Me" section that serves as an introduction, detailing my background as a Mechatronics Engineer transitioning into software development.
* **Projects Page (projects.html):** A dedicated page showcasing three key projects in a responsive grid layout. Each project is presented on a "card" with an image, description, and a link to view more.
* **Contact Page (contact.html):** A clean and functional contact form that allows visitors to get in touch easily.
* A consistent, shared header and footer across all pages for a unified navigation experience.
* Fully responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes using modern CSS techniques.

## Features implemented

* **Multi-Page Architecture (MPA):** The site is structured into separate HTML files (index.html, projects.html, contact.html) for clear content separation.
* **Semantic HTML5 Structure:** Utilizes modern HTML5 tags like <header>, <main>, <section>, and <article> for a well-organized, accessible, and SEO-friendly document.
* **External CSS with Modern Practices:** All styling is handled by a single, well-structured styles.css file.
* **Flexbox for 1D Layouts:** Strategically used for one-dimensional alignment in components like the site header and the contact form.
* **CSS Grid for 2D Layouts:** Implemented to create the robust and responsive grid for the project showcase on the projects.html page.
* **Responsive Design with Media Queries:** Employs breakpoints at 1024px, 768px, and 480px to restructure the layout, ensuring optimal viewing on all devices.
* **CSS Variables (Custom Properties):** The entire color scheme and font system are managed by variables in the :root selector, making the design themeable and easy to maintain.
* **Interactive Hover Effects:** Smooth, CSS-based transitions are applied to all interactive elements (buttons, links, project cards) to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3 (External Stylesheet)

## How to View

1. Download or clone the project files.

3. Open index.html in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
4. Navigate between the "About", "Projects", and "Contact" pages using the main navigation.
