# Miguel Canedo - Personal Portfolio Website 

This project is a single-page personal portfolio website, initially built with HTML and internal CSS, and subsequently enhanced by refactoring CSS into an external stylesheet and applying advanced CSS techniques. It showcases my profile, skills, and projects with a focus on clean design, semantic structure, and engaging visual effects.
